# creating a promotions class which would have many to many relationship with products
# products can have different promotions and promotions can apply to different products
# we know that when we define a relationship in one class, django automatically creates the reverse relationship..
# .. in the other class concerned. we just need to decide where we want to define the relationship first
# in this case it makes sense to define this relationship between products and promotions in the product class
# so that along side every product, the promotion that applies to it is shown
# see promotions field defined in products class below, django then defines the reverse relation to link the promtions class

    # we also have a field called featured_product which is a dependency on the product class
    # if you look at the product class we also have a field called collections which initiates...
    # ..a dependency of the products class on the collections class also
    # this is thus a circular dependency
    # if you remove the quotes from "Product" above, you see an unresolved reference error
    # because product class has not been defined before collections class and hence quotes needed
    # if we ever rename the products class we would need to rename that string also

    # another issue is that as we know, django automatically creates a reverse relationship..
    #..  in the products class to complete the relation we defined when we create the feautured_product field
    # that is we would have a field named collections in the product class
    # but we already have defined a field named collections in the products class below
    # django therefore cant create the reverse relationship because of the name clash
    # the solution is to use the related_name argument in the featured_name field above
    # we can set the name of the reverse relationship django creates to something we want...
    #.. or just use a "+" in there if we dont care about the reverse relationship
    # the "+" tells django not to create that reverse relationship
