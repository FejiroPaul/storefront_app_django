    # the interesting thing is how do we identify the object that the tag above is applied to
    # the poor way of doing this is done in line below

    # product = models.ForeignKey(Product)

    # if doing the line above we would need to import the product model from the store app
    # so that we can reference the product app and the taggeditem model becomes dependent on it
    # we dont want to do this
    # not efficient especially if we need to import more models from other apps

    # what we need is a generic way to identify an object. to do this we need two things
    # Type(e.g product, video, article)   and  ID
    # with these we can identify any objects in our applications
    # for Type, we do this using django's abstract model called contenttype
    # this contenttype app is in our lists of installled apps in setting.py
    # using contenttype class from that app we can create generic relationships between our models
    # we import the class at top of the script
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)# cascade to remove all asscoiated types if a content type is removed

    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    # we make this field a positive integer field because we assume that all tables will have primary keys...
    #.. and all primary keys are positive integers
    # if in a particular table the primary key is not an integer, this solution wont work, thats its limitation

    # to then get the actual object the tag is applied to
    content_object = GenericForeignKey()
    # using the content_object field above, we can then read the actual object that a tag is applied to

    # creating an objects field which is an instance of the TaggedItemManager class defined above
    objects = TaggedItemManager()
